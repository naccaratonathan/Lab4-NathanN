Create a int variable for the lawn mower
create a int variable rectangular lawn (robotX, robotY)
create constructors
set starting position for the robot at 0,0 (bottom left corner)
in a while or for loop robotX++ until reaching a piece of grass that is unmowed once grass = mowed
robotY +1 and robox X -- until grass == mowed then repeat until entire lawn is mowed

to fix starting facing a wall

if (robotX++ != red && (robotY % 2) == 0) moves right to bottom right corner
    robotX++
    if (robotY++ != red && robotX++ == red){  moves from bottom right up 1

    else if (robotX-- != red && (robotY % 2) > 0){ //moves to top left
        robotX--
        if (robotY++ != red && robotX-- == red){
